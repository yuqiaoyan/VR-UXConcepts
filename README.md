Prototyping UX interactions for VR

This prototype is built for Unity 5.5 for the HTC Vive.

I was inspired to start this project when I noticed how much I struggled to search for apps in VR, and how unnatural it felt to input text. Is there a way to input text for a search that feels more natural and comfortable? That's the problem I'm trying to solve. This basic prototype allows you to write on a whiteboard to enter a search query.
